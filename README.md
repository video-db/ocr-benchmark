# Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Optical Character Recognition in Dynamic Video Environments

This repository contains a benchmarking framework for evaluating OCR (Optical Character Recognition) performance using multiple vision-language models (VLMs) and OCR engines. The framework is designed to work with [VideoDB public collections](https://docs.videodb.io/public-collections-102) and supports several models including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Moondream, EasyOCR, and RapidOCR.

For detailed methodology and analysis, please refer to our paper: [Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Optical Character Recognition in Dynamic Video Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06445)

## Overview

This project benchmarks OCR performance across different models by:
- Extracting scenes from videos using [VideoDB](https://videodb.io).
- Running OCR on the extracted frames using various models.
- Comparing OCR outputs against ground truth to compute error metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER).

The modular design allows you to easily extend the framework by adding new models or other vision tasks.

### Benchmark Results

## Dataset

The dataset is based on [VideoDB's public collection](https://docs.videodb.io/public-collections-102). This public collection provides open access to a curated set of videos along with their pre-defined scene indexes. Anyone with the VideoDB ID can access these videos and read their corresponding indexes. This feature facilitates easy benchmarking and reproducibility.

Here are the videos of VideoDB's OCR Benchmark Public Collection (`c-c0a2c223-e377-4625-94bf-910501c2a31c`)

## Results

The benchmarking framework organizes outputs and logs in a structured directory hierarchy to help you review and interpret the performance of each model. Below is a sample directory tree for an OpenAI run (e.g., using GPT-4O) that illustrates how the results are organized:

```
gpt_results/
└── gpt-4o/
    └── ocr_2025-02-06_16-32-48/
        ├── evaluations/
        │   └── m-z-0194c270-bbfb-7dd2-aaec-62d909b97b32.json
        ├── logfile.log
        └── m-z-0194c270-bbfb-7dd2-aaec-62d909b97b32_output.json

evaluation_summary/
└── ocr_2025-02-06_16-32-48.json
```

### Key Components

- **Model-Specific Folders:**  
  In the above example, results for the OpenAI model (e.g., GPT-4O) are stored under `gpt_results/gpt-4o/`. Each run is organized into a timestamped folder (e.g., `ocr_2025-02-06_16-32-48`).

- **Output Files:**  
  Within the run folder, the output JSON file (e.g., `m-z-0194c270-bbfb-7dd2-aaec-62d909b97b32_output.json`) contains the OCR predictions for a given video. This file includes details such as:
  - The video ID.
  - Scene start and end times.
  - Processing time.
  - Image URLs.
  - The OCR text output generated by the model.

- **Evaluation Files:**  
  In the `evaluations` subfolder, JSON files (e.g., `m-z-0194c270-bbfb-7dd2-aaec-62d909b97b32.json`) contain quantitative metrics calculated by comparing the model's OCR output against the ground truth. These metrics include:
  - Character Error Rate (CER)
  - Word Error Rate (WER)
  - Accuracy
  - Order-Agnostic Accuracy

- **Log Files:**  
  The `logfile.log` file records detailed processing information, including timestamps and status messages, which are useful for debugging and verifying that each run executed as expected.

- **Evaluation Summary:**  
  Aggregated summary files in the `evaluation_summary` folder provide an overview of performance metrics across different runs and models, facilitating high-level comparisons of model performance.

### Interpreting the Results

- **Output Files (Predictions):**  
  The JSON output files present the raw OCR text generated by the model for each scene. By comparing this output with the ground truth (referenced in the evaluation files), you can visually assess the accuracy of the OCR process.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  The evaluation files quantify performance using:
  - **CER (Character Error Rate):** Lower CER indicates a higher precision at the character level.
  - **WER (Word Error Rate):** Lower WER indicates fewer mistakes in recognizing words.
  - **Accuracy:** A higher percentage represents better overall text recognition.
  - **Order-Agnostic Accuracy:** Useful for understanding text recognition performance independent of word order.

- **Log Files:**  
  The logs provide a narrative of the processing events, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the run.

This structure allows you to systematically access and evaluate the OCR outputs and associated metrics for models, ensuring that you can effectively compare performance and diagnose any issues.

## Preparing Your Own Ground Truth

```bash
uv run ground_truth_preparation/create_videodb_collection.py
```
This script will prompt for collection details and allow you to upload videos either from files or by specifying a JSON file containing video URLs. The collection will be created as a [VideoDB public collection](https://docs.videodb.io/public-collections-102) for easy sharing and reproducibility.

```bash
uv run ground_truth_preparation/prepare_ground_truth.py
```
This script extracts frames from videos, performs OCR, and stores the ground truth in the ocr_ground_truths directory to get you started, you can then manually inspect and refine the data.

It was also sending off requests this way and the next, which weren't really necessary. All I really wanted was a simple speed dial, and some motivational text. So thats what I did!

To meet this goal, our AI will decide the best move for a given Tetris piece by trying out all the possible moves (rotation and position).

The score for each move is computed by assessing the grid the move would result in. This assessment is based on four heuristics: aggregate height, complete lines, holes, and bumpiness, each of which the AI will try to either minimize or maximize.
